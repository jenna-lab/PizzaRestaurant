This project is on an API for tracking pizzas restaurants.
You need to create a Rails API backend.Have at least three resources (three DB tables)

## SetUp/Installation requirements

- Generate a new Rails application using the rails new myapp --skip-javascript command in your terminal.
- Define your database schema by creating migration files that define the tables and columns for the database. You can use the rails generate migration command to generate migration files.
- Create your models by running the rails generate model command in your terminal. Your models should reflect the associations you want to create between your tables.
- Define the associations in your models.e.g has_many, belongs_to, and has_many :through methods to define associations.
- Seed your database with sample data using the rails db:seed command.
- Test your associations by running your Rails server (rails server in your terminal) and using a tool like Postman to send requests to your application's endpoints. You can use the Rails console (rails console in your terminal) to test your associations as well.
- And finally,you can deploy your application.
